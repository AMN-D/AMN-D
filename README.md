<u>A bit about me</u>: I’m a CSE-DS Major with Honors in Cyber Security. I’ve worked with Python, Java, HTML/CSS, and relational database projects. I’ve also built several AI models during my university days. I prefer using OSS over proprietary tools. I daily drive Linux (Arch - Hyprland), and as a hobby, I tinker with the OS.
